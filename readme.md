So yeah this is a Tic Tac Toe game.
I made this with the help of a few online tutorials and examples. Really nothing special, but had fun doing it.
Everything happens on the console.
You play it by typing in the position of the field you want to make your move in. So for example 2 3.
Haven't documented it yet. So I still need to do that. 
I'll probably also add a GUI. But haven't really found the time for that yet.
